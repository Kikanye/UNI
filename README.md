# UNI
University Network Interface

## Elevator Pitch 
The elevator pitch as presented to John Braico:
UNI is an application that will allow University of Manitoba students create sport or study events on campus and will allow other students that have an interest in that event to join in. This will fulfill the desire for students to meet other students with similar interests.
